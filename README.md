### Scoring Coding

**Scoring Design**

1. Rank Qual, Mom, Val, Size T-stats & if they are greater than 2.581 (99% confidence) place them in that category, UNLESS,

the value stat is less than -2.581 and the absolute value of it is > than the highest ranked t-stat (as then it would be growth)

2. See if they have a Tracking error of less than 2%, if so, they are "beta".

3. If they aren't any of those, then Alpha.
